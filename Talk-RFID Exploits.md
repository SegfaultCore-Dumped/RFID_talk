1. **Introduction**

RFID technology is not new by any means, but only recently has it garnered enough attention to be on its way to becoming an everyday concept. Similar to the computer networking technologies that were invented in the late 60's and 70's that have now become pervasive due to the widespread adoption of the Internet, some people say RFID technology is poised to become ubiquitous as the "Internet of things" (a term coined at M.I.T. to describe a network of RFID enabled objects) gains momentum. This paper will talk in depth about Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and more specifically about how one person may exploit this technology, whether it's just a tag for entering a building, or something a lot more serious like a chip in someone's e-passport.

**2.1 Definition of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)**

RFID is a form of wireless communication that incorporates the use of electromagnetic or electrostatic coupling in the radio frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum to uniquely identify an object, animal or person. It consists of three major components: a scanning antenna and transceiver, which may also be combined into one reader (known as en interrogator) and a transponder, called the RFID tag. An RFID tag consists of a microchip, memory and antenna.

RFID tags typically hold less than 2,000 KB of data, including a unique identifier or serial number. Tags can be read-only or read-write, where data can be added by the reader or existing data overwritten. The read range for RFID tags varies based on factors including the type of tag, the type of reader, RFID frequency, and interference in the surrounding environment or from other RFID tags and readers. Active RFID tags have a longer read range than passive RFID tags due to the stronger power source.(1,2,4)

There are three main types of RFID systems: low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF) and ultra-high frequency (UHF). Microwave RFID is also available. Frequencies vary greatly by country and region. Low-frequency RFID systems range from 30 KHz to 500 KHz, though the typical frequency is 125 KHz 2.  LF RFID has short transmission ranges, generally anywhere from a few inches to less than six feet. High-frequency RFID systems range from 3 MHz to 30 MHz, with the typical HF frequency being 13.56 MHz. The standard range is anywhere from a few inches to several feet. UHF RFID systems range from 300 MHz to 960 MHz, with the typical frequency of 433 MHz and can generally be read from more than 25 feet away. Microwave RFID systems run at 2.45 GHz and can be read from more than 30 feet away.

The frequency used will depend on the RFID application, with actual obtained distances sometimes varying considerably from what might be expected. For example, when the U.S. State Department announced it was to issue electronic passports enabled with an RFID chip, it said the chips would only be able to be read from approximately four inches away. However, the State Department was soon confronted with evidence that RFID readers could skim the information from the RFID tags from much farther than 4 inches, some claiming upward of 33 feet away, proving the difference between advertised and actual range can vary immensely.

**2.2 History of RFID**

In 1946 Léon Theremin invented an espionage tool for the Soviet Union which retransmitted incident radio waves with audio information. Sound waves vibrated a diaphragm which slightly altered the shape of the resonator, which modulated the reflected radio frequency. Even though this device was a passive covert listening device, not an identification tag, it has been attributed as a predecessor to RFID technology. The technology used in RFID has been around since early 1920.

Similar technology, such as the IFF transponder invented in the United Kingdom in 1939, was routinely used by the allies in World War II to identify aircraft as friend or enemies. Transponders are still used by most powered aircrafts to this day.

Another early work exploring RFID is the landmark 1948 paper by Harry Stockman, titled “Communication by Means of Reflected Power” (Proceedings of the IRE, pp 1196–1204, October 1948). Stockman predicted that “…considerable research and development work has to be done before the remaining basic problems in reflected-power communication are solved, and before the field of useful applications is explored.”

Mario Cardullo’s U.S. Patent 3,713,148 in 1973 was the first true ancestor of modern RFID; a passive radio transponder with memory. The initial device was passive, powered by the interrogating signal and consisted of a transponder with 16-bit memory for use as a toll device, which was demonstrated to the New York Port Authority and other potential users in 1971. The basic Cardullo patent covers the use of radio frequency, sound and light as transmission media. The original business plan presented to investors in 1969 showed uses in transportation (automotive vehicle identification, automatic toll system, electronic license plate, electronic manifest, vehicle routing, vehicle performance monitoring), banking (electronic check book, electronic credit card), security (personnel identification, automatic gates, surveillance) and medical (identification, patient history).

A very early demonstration of reflected power (modulated backscatter) RFID tags, both passive and semi-passive, was performed by Steven Depp, Alfred Koelle and Robert Freyman at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1973. The portable system operated at 915 MHz and used 12-bit tags. This technique is used by most of the today’s UHFID and microwave RFID tags.

The first patent to be associated with the abbreviation RFID was granted to Charles Walton in 1983 U.S. Patent 4,384,288

**2.3 How it works**

A RFID system is composed of three essential parts: a scanning antenna, a transceiver with a decoder to interpret the data, and a transponder, which is the RFID tag, that has been programmed with information.

The scanning antenna puts out radio-frequency signals in a relatively short range. The radio frequency radiation provides the means of communicating with the transponder and provides the RFID tag with the energy to communicate. This is a key part of the technology; RFID tags do not need to contain batteries and can therefore remain usable for very long periods of time.

When an RFID tag passes through the field of the scanning antenna, it detects the activation signal from the antenna. That brings to life the RFID chip, and it transmits the information on its microchip to be picked up by the scanning antenna.

RFID tags can be read in a wide variety of circumstances, where barcodes or other optically reading technologies are useless. The tag does not need to be on the surface of the object. The read time is typically less than 100 milliseconds, and large numbers of tags can be read all at once.

**2.4 Fields of use**

RFID technology can be found in many different fields from logistics to Surgeries to passing by passports. In logistics, tagging goods and pallets, you can instantly know what goods you have, how many they are and how much space they occupy in a warehouse or back store just when they are entered.

We can also track animals by tagging them with RFID. It can be an important tool for a farmer, in order to identify each animal with its information like origin, pedigree, medical details, etc. As well as with the help of software, to keep updated the information by uploading the new information like veterinary visits.

RFID technology in hospitals is present in many forms, from tracking surgical tools to tracking persons –patients, visitors and staff. There are several important reasons to use RFID technology in the healthcare industry from reducing medical errors like losing essential surgery tools or forgetting surgery sponges within patients, as well as reducing economic costs or increasing the security at healthcare buildings.

Passports with an embedded chip are called biometric passport, e-Passport or digital passport. This chip has biometric information that is used to authenticate the identity of the passport holder. The information stored in RFID chips of e-Passports depends on the country’s policy. Data usually stored are name, date and place of birth, sex, nationality and a digital version of the photograph. Data about the passport are in the chip too, such as the number, issue date and place, and the expiration date. The standardized biometrics used for identification system are facial recognition, fingerprint recognition or iris recognition.

**2.5 Known flaws**

With every popular technology comes lots of curious minded people, some who may intend to do well, and upgrade flaws once discovered, but the world is sadly not full of only good people. Here I will list popular attacks that can be done on a RFID system.

The most popular one we see in lots of different fields is reverse engineering. Like most products, RFID tags and readers can be reverse engineered; however, it would take a lot of knowledge about the protocols and features to be successful. Hackers would take apart the chip in order to find out how it works in order to play with the data. This would allow one to steal and/or gain access to sensitive information.

Power analysis can also be suitable in order to find an exploit. This attack requires nothing more than the brain of a hacker and a cell phone. According to leading experts, power analysis attacks can be mounted on RFID systems by monitoring the power consumption levels of RFID tags. Researchers stumbled upon this hacking technique when studying the power emission levels in smart cards, especially in the difference in power levels between a correct passcode and an incorrect passcode.

Eavesdropping, like it sounds, occurs when an unauthorized RFID reader listens to conversations between a tag and reader then obtains important data. It is still necessary for the hacker to know the specific protocols and tag and reader information for this technique to work.

A man-in-the-middle attack happens during the transmission of a signal. Like eavesdropping, the hacker listens for communication between a tag and reader and then intercepts and manipulates the information. The hacker diverts the original signal and then sends false data while pretending to be a normal component in the RFID system. This would allow someone to take down the system.

A Denial of Service attack is the broad concept of an RFID system failure that is associated with an attack. These attacks are usually physical attacks like jamming the system with noise interference, blocking radio signals, or even removing or disabling RFID tags. It would also, just like the man in the middle attack, take down the system.

Technically two specific events, cloning and spoofing are usually done back to back. Cloning is duplicating data from a pre-existing tag, and spoofing is then using the cloned tag to gain access to a secured area or item. Because the hacker must know the data on the tag to clone it, this type of attack is mainly seen in access or asset management operations. This would allow someone to gain access to the machine.

According to some sources, RFID tags currently do not have enough memory capacity to store a virus; but in the future, viruses could be a serious threat to an RFID system. A virus programmed on an RFID tag by an unknown source could cripple an RFID system when the tagged item is read at a facility. When read, the virus would transfer from tag to reader and then to a company’s network and software – bringing down connected computers, RFID components, and networks.

**2.6 Different ways to exploit a RFID**

These attacks allow some hackers to exploit this system in many ways. Sniffing the communication between the transponder and the reader would allow the hacker to counterfeit the communication, obtain UID, his data and his meta data. He would also be able to make basic attacks on the structures and tags and make replay attacks to fool the access control systems. A hacker may also be able to counterfeit the identity of the reader and start unauthorized writing to the tag, giving him the possibility the either change the UID via manipulation of the administrative block or even declare false identity. However, the UID must be readable in clear text.

Manipulation of the data stored on the transponder is also possible. The hacker would then be able to manipulate data and/or metadata and make logical duplications of objects.

An attacker may also be able to deactivate the transponder in order to disable the traceability of objects and their visibility. An Attack on the structures in the middleware and backends with manipulation of data structures would let the hacker inject malware into the backend and middleware systems or place worms.

Another known way of attacking a RFID system is with a radio frequency jammer. The use of an “out the box” police jammer would jam the transmitter, preventing the reading of the tag or shutdown the production, sales and access of the system.

There is no need to try and brute force a RFID system, because this would take for too long (around 22000 years with one reader). However, if encrypted, they are some popular keys to try-out such as:

A A0 A1 A2 A3 4 A5

A FF FF FF FF FF FF

B B0 B1 B2 B3 B4 B5

B FF FF FF FF FF FF

If no protection, 00 00 00 00 00 00

**3.1 RFID in passports**

Now this is where the real danger starts. If it's so easy to exploit a RFID system, and so many tools to do so are public on the internet, why aren’t more people concerned about the danger in e-Passports or biometric passports?

A biometric passport (also known as an e-passport or a digital passport) is a traditional passport that has an embedded electronic microprocessor chip which contains biometric information that can be used to authenticate the identity of the passport holder. It uses contactless smart card technology, including a microprocessor chip (computer chip) and an antenna (for both power to the chip and communication) embedded in the front or back cover, or centre page, of the passport. The passport's critical information is both printed on the data page of the passport and stored in the chip. Public key infrastructure (PKI) is used to authenticate the data stored electronically in the passport chip making it expensive and difficult to forge when all security mechanisms are fully and correctly implemented. Many countries are moving towards the issue of biometric passports. As of December 2008, 60 countries were issuing such passports, increasing to 120 as of June 2017.

As previously stated, the currently standardised biometrics used for this type of identification system are facial recognition, fingerprint recognition, and iris recognition. These were adopted after assessment of several different kinds of biometrics including retinal scanning. Document and chip characteristics are documented in the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) Doc 9303. The ICAO defines the biometric file formats and communication protocols to be used in passports. Only the digital image (usually in JPEG or JPEG2000 format) of each biometric feature is stored in the chip. The comparison of biometric features is performed outside the passport chip by electronic border control systems (e-borders). To store biometric data on the contactless chip, it includes a minimum of 32 kilobytes of EEPROM storage memory and runs on an interface in accordance with the ISO/IEC 14443 international standard, amongst others. These standards intend interoperability between different countries and different manufacturers of passport books.

**3.2 Exploits in passport** 

**3.2.1 Do RFID passports make us vulnerable to identity theft?**

In order to understand how vulnerable people are to identity theft, the following extract from … highlights a typical ID theft situation.

*For some, It's a beautiful day when your plane touches down at the airport. After a long vacation, you might feel rejuvenated, refreshed, and relaxed. When you get home, everything is how you left it—the tables, the chairs, even the now-mouldy sandwich you forgot on the counter. Everything, that is, but a pile of envelopes on the floor that jammed the door as you tried to swing it open. You notice a blinking light on your answering machine and realize you've missed dozens of messages. As you click on the machine and pick up the envelopes, you find that most of the messages and letters are from debt collectors. Most of the envelopes are stamped "urgent," and as you sift through the pile you can hear the messages from angry creditors demanding that you call them immediately. Reading the bank statements, you suddenly realize that someone has been charging large amounts of money to an account in your name from a credit card company you've never heard of. You've lost thousands of dollars, and suddenly you aren't feeling quite so relaxed anymore.*

*How could someone have been stealing money from you like this while you were away on vacation? The thievery actually began months before you even left home. Several months ago, as you were casually walking through the airport en route to a business meeting in Europe, someone was lingering close behind. As you approached a security agent to have your passport checked, this individual used a small antenna connected to a computer in his backpack to eavesdrop on the radio communication between the security agent's reader, which has the capacity to decrypt the highly sensitive and secured data on the passport, and the RFID-enabled passport itself.*

*If the attacker had tried to skim the information off your passport by imitating a legitimate reader, the chip would never have provided the personal data within, as the correct access key would not have been given. Since the attacker was merely intercepting the communication with an antenna, however, he was able to collect all of the data. Private information, including not only basic information about your identity but even a digitized photograph, had been stolen from you that moment when you thought your passport was safely in the hands of a government official. You moved on without any clue as to how deeply your privacy had been violated in an attack that you had no idea was occurring.*

*At that point, all the perpetrator needed to do was use the data to create a new passport, use that passport to get a Social Security number, and then create credit card accounts in your name, with your identity, and run amok with your finances.*

An RFID-passport attack of this nature is more plausible than other methods, such as skimming the RFID information. Although simple to do, skimming will not yield the information needed to enable identity theft because of preventive measures integrated into the system. The first of these measures is encryption. According to the Department of State: "When a reader attempts to scan the passport, it engages in a challenge-response protocol that proves knowledge of the pair of keys and derives a session key. If authentication is successful, the passport releases its data contents; otherwise, the reader is deemed unauthorized and the passport refuses read access." (source)

Additionally, newer passport covers are being lined with materials that block RFID signals from being transmitted when the passport is closed, exposing the document to attack only when it is opened and displayed for a security agent. Relatively inexpensive signal-blocking sleeves are also available for RFID passports.

**3.2.2 What Information is Compromised?**

Six pieces of information can be stolen from the RFID chip on a U.S. passport: your name, nationality, gender, date of birth, place of birth, and a digitized photograph.1 Numerous problems of identity theft could arise from someone taking that information, but this article focuses on the financial risk.

Banks in the U.S. require that applicants for credit cards submit their Social Security numbers to be used for background credit checks. Although the passport RFID tag does not carry your Social Security number, a perpetrator can use the information it does contain to obtain your number. The Social Security Administration's Web site requires one of three proofs of identity for a U.S. citizen to be issued a new Social Security card: a driver's license, state-issued non-driver identity card, or passport. With the data stolen from your passport's RFID chip, someone could create a copy of the passport, then use this fake to access a real copy of your Social Security card. With your Social Security card, the perpetrator is free to apply for a real copy of your credit card, not to mention opening new accounts in your name. This puts you at a serious financial risk, all because someone was able to eavesdrop on your passport's RFID communication.

**3.2.3 Technology Requirements**

To eavesdrop on your passport information, a perpetrator needs hardware to capture the signal as it is being scanned by a legitimate RFID reader, such as those used by government officials at airports. He or she would then need the time and technical capacity to decrypt the signal into a usable form. Finally, to reap any real benefits from the stolen information, the attacker needs to have all the materials necessary to reproduce a passport. We can view this as a series of hurdles that the perpetrator needs to overcome, starting with data capture, moving onto data recovery, and finally data reproduction.

Let us first focus on capturing the information from your passport, since it is at that point in the event chain that the vulnerabilities of the RFID technology are exploited. For successful data retrieval the perpetrator's antenna needs to catch two different interactions: the forward channel, which is the signal being sent from the RFID reader to the RFID token; and the backward channel, which is the data being sent back from the RFID token to the RFID reader. Lab demonstrations3 have shown that a successful eavesdrop (a capture of both channels) on an RFID tag can occur at a distance of one meter with the use of an H-field antenna, a radio frequency receiver, an oscilloscope to monitor the signals, and a computer to store, analyse, and manipulate the data.

In the lab this was done as a proof of concept, but in the real world a perpetrator could use smaller, more discrete hardware. In our airport scenario, the perpetrator would need only an antenna and an amplifier to boost the signal capture, a radio-frequency mixer and filter, and a computer to store the data. The amplifier itself would not even need to be that powerful, since it would need to boost the signal over only a short distance of three to five meters. The antenna, mixer, and filter can be home-made with cheap materials or purchased as a set online. Some Web sites contain schematics, lists of materials, and steps on how to build your own RFID reader the size of a matchbox. These RFID "sniffers" can then be plugged into a laptop via a USB port. Once the perpetrator has successfully eavesdropped on the communication between the RFID token and the RFID reader, the next step is data recovery. This requires two separate steps. The first is recovering the actual signal between the RFID chip in the passport and the RFID reader. This is a signal-processing problem, essentially separating the actual signal from the noise of the background. Proof-of-concept experiments3 have shown that data recovery is a brute-force problem that can be solved with current hardware. A perpetrator would need only to record the data passed between the RFID and receiver on location, and then could perform the time-consuming signal-processing operations at home. A large part of data recovery is extracting the data from the electrical noise of the environment, which is simplified by taking a noise profile of the environment. The same Web sites that provide schematics for readers also provide code for decoding the data, although the effectiveness of their programs on new passports has yet to be tested.

Once the signal has been recovered, it has to be interpreted as data. The difficulty of this step depends entirely on whether and how well the data is encrypted. The encryption key is generated from information on the passport—specifically, the name, date of birth, and passport number. There are reports that this key can be easily cracked, because the algorithm used to produce the key is predictable. An analysis published by the International Association of Cryptologic Research indicates that the entropy of the resulting key is on the order of 52 bits, which, while something of a challenge, is not impossible to crack.4 We assume here that decryption is practical; if it is not, then the possibility of these attacks is minimized. After recovering the data, the perpetrator would have everything necessary to make a new passport with the captured information. The steps required for this are beyond the scope of this article, but since counterfeiting of passports has been demonstrated and documented, it is enough to say that this is feasible.

**3.2.4 Costs to the Perpetrator**

What we have shown so far is that with the right equipment and skill, a perpetrator can intercept the signal between a passport and RFID reader, then forge the passport to use for identity theft. The more important question, however, is whether the cost of this doing can be justified by the return.

This question is predicated on the assumption that the encryption of the information held in the passport's RFID tag can be broken. While there is some evidence that this has been true in the past, stronger encryption could increase the cost of the attack considerably, to the point of making it either economically unattractive or technically impossible.

In our airport scenario, a perpetrator would have to cover several costs before reaching the ultimate goal of financial gain. To begin with, there are the hardware costs. The combined cost of the antenna, amplifier, radio mixer, filter, USB connection, and laptop would be on the order of $1,000. These are all fixed costs, and the perpetrator would presumably cover these by using the hardware to execute numerous attacks over a period of time.

There is also a cost associated with access to the passport reader. It is reasonable to assume that the perpetrator would have to purchase an airline ticket to enter the area where passports are scanned.

The cost of being caught must be a factor. Compared with other technologically intensive (e.g., online) fraudulent attacks, theft of passport RFID data might involve greater risk because of the physical proximity required to eavesdrop on the RFID communication. The risk-adjusted cost of being caught is quite significant when you consider the prevalence of security officers within airports and the severity of the crime.

Presuming that the attacker manages to escape with the raw data from an eavesdropping operation, it still has to be interpreted at home. The software costs are negligible (open source code for specifically this function is available on the Internet) as are the costs of the processing time. In one example, it took less than an hour to recover the passport signal, and this process can be automated.3 Although we have not verified this (since verification would require snooping a passport in a noisy environment such as an airport), the approach presented seemed plausible.

Jeroen van Beek of the University of Amsterdam managed to forge a passport RFID chip for $120.5 This cost is not always necessary because a U.S. passport remains valid even if it is not fitted with an RFID chip or if the chip has failed. (Since all passports issued after 2007 have an embedded RFID chip and are valid for a maximum of 10 years, the ability to use a passport without such a chip will end after 2017.) Rather, the most significant cost is in obtaining or producing a realistic-looking passport in which to print the information. The cost of a blank passport book is difficult to determine, but there are some indications that it is not an insubstantial part of the cost of this form of identity theft. In 2008, for example, 3,000 blank UK passports were stolen, and officials valued each one at approximately $3,000.

Estimating the revenues that could be generated also requires some inference. In the U.S., the mean fraud amount per victim for identity theft-related crimes in 2008 was $4,849.2 The potential revenue from the passport identity theft example, however, could conceivably be higher because of the relative ease with which a passport can be used to open new accounts and prove identity, in comparison with the most common current forms of fraud using stolen credit cards, checks, or mail. Nevertheless, comparing this figure to the $3,000 cost of a blank passport (which is just one of the many costs of creating a fake passport) reveals that the operation may not be as profitable as one might have thought.

**3.4 How to improve the security of biometric passports**

A number of countermeasures have been suggested int order to stay protected against RFID privacy risks (not specific to the passport example), including permanent tag deactivation ("killing"), temporary tag deactivation (using Faraday cages or sleep/wake modes, for example), and access-control mechanisms (hash locks, pseudonyms, blocker tags).

More effective countermeasures require changes to current government policy. The government can take steps to improve the security and privacy of passports. The basic access-control system of a U.S passport encrypts communication between it and the RFID reader with a key generated from the information written on the passport; the key containing the holder's information is susceptible to brute-force attacks, however, since it has low entropy. One countermeasure would be to add a 128-bit secret, printed on the passport and unique to each passport, to the key derivation algorithm.

The interception of communications between RFID tag and reader is possible because no material capable of blocking RF signals surrounds the passport-control area. Thus, another countermeasure would be to install an enclosure to block RFID transmission outside of the immediate area. Increased security around the passport-control area could also minimize the possibility of intrusion on the communication between tag and reader.

**4. Conclusion**

Having looked at the potential attack, the costs of that attack, and the returns, it could be asked how concerned people should be about such an exploit. Should they really be worried as they walk through the airport that someone behind them might be stripping them of your passport information in the grand scheme of robbing them?

The technical hurdles are surmountable, at least in proof-of-concept demonstrations. It is possible that such an attack could occur, but this possibility needs to be balanced against the complexity of the attack, the difficulty of obtaining the required high-priced blank passport, and the limited return the attack is likely to produce.

It seems much more likely that most perpetrators would resort to old-fashioned means of stealing your passport information, by stealing your physical passport itself. We recommend that it is more important to be careful about keeping your physical passport safely in hand than to be wary of perpetrators lurking behind you in line at the airport attempting to exploit the RFID tag in your passport.
